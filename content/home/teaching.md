{{< icon name="chess" pack="fas" >}} **Chess and Science**

Since 2015, I teach this biannual course at [Tres de Febrero National University](https://www.untref.edu.ar/carrera/diplomatura-universitaria-en-ensenanza-del-ajedrez), where I give an academic overview of **chess** both as a subject and as an experimental paradigm to answer more general scientific questions.

In 2016, I took on the challenge of teaching science (in English) for first-year high-school students at the bilingual school [Colegio Santa Teresita](https://www.colegiosteresita.edu.ar/web/test-index), where we learnt about physical, chemical and biological processes both in the classroom and at the lab.
