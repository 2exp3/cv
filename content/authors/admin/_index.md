I am a PhD candidate studying how contextual factors modulate decision-making using computational models. 

I also have been teaching Chess and Science since 2015 at [Tres de Febrero National University](https://www.untref.edu.ar/carrera/diplomatura-universitaria-en-ensenanza-del-ajedrez) where I give an academic overview of Chess both as a subject and as a experimental tool for science.

My overarching philosophy is facing the challenges attached to learning new skills and knowledge. This plasticity has landed me jobs as a session guitar player, as an MC for a [Zoo and Aquariums conference](https://www.waza2019.org/), as a (small-role) singer in a [movie](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco:_El_padre_Jorge), and many other non-paid escapades.
